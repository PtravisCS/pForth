# Pforth #

An attempt at a basic FORTH interpreter.
In addition to attempting a FORTH interpetation, I have attempted an addition of better string handling to the language

## TODO ##

* Add a means for users to create new WORDS and add them to the dictionary
* Modify data type of main stack S.T. it can handle ints and strings instead of having two separate stacks for string and int operations
* Modify main operation functions S.T. they can handle ints and strings with predictable behaviour
* Refactor code to remove as much as possible from Main
